# aly's basic calculator
I created this calculator as a mini project to practice web development. I followed a couple of YouTube tutorials to guide me through the structure, styling, and logic. I never expected it to look and work this well! 

This was a fun, especially for someone just starting out. Highly recommend it to other beginners!

## Technologies Used
HTML
CSS 
JavaScript

### Design Inspiration
The UI design was inspired by this awesome YouTube tutorial: https://youtu.be/dDGvSX6vTFY?si=Q47YVncgeuZH9RTq

### Logic & Functionality Tutorial
I followed another great video that goes into the calculator's JavaScript logic: https://youtu.be/EerdGm-ehJQ?si=XWvNeb_Iufq-wBlt
Both of these are really good for beginners and helped me learn a lot â€” not just about code, but also how to bring everything together in a real project.

### Made with help from ChatGPT
Yep, I also used ChatGPT here and there to figure things out and clean up some of the code and explanations, also for me to not go insane. Thanks, AI buddy! Hehehehehe
